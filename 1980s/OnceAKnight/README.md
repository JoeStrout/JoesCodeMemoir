# Once a Knight

_My deepest foray into Infocom-style interactive fiction_

This was an advanced Applesoft BASIC project to create a work of interactive fiction, driven by puzzles, story, and humor in the style of the great Infocom adventures.  By this point I believe I had played quite a few: Zork, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Leather Goddesses of Phobos stand out in my mind.  I loved these games, and respected the quality of their code; they created detailed, simulated worlds in which the player was free to do almost anything, and also had an amazingly advanced understanding of natural English commands.

I believe I had already created the SHIRE adventures by this point, which was inspired by an earlier open-source project called EAMON.  That used simple VERB-OBJECT style commands, but I was eager to try creating a real sentence parser, and also to make a much deeper game.  I succeeded on both counts; Once A Knight's parser was even more advanced than Infocom's, and the game was certainly deeper and more sophisticated than any I'd made before.

I tried to get Infocom themselves interested in the game.  I sent them a proposal packet with detailed game-design documents, including a walk-through outlining all the puzzles, sample descriptions, and more.  They sent me a polite rejection letter.  So I resolved to continue work on it myself.

I poured lots of time into programming this game, and writing all the descriptions and other text that go into it.  So much time that my father grew concerned I was becoming obsessed, and threatened one day to destroy my work.  I wept and begged him not to, and he relented.  Thereafter I kept multiple copies of the code hidden on misleadingly-labeled disks, so I wouldn't risk losing all my hard work.

I was in high school at this point -- perhaps a sophomore?  Alas, demands of school and real life, and my general tendency to get distracted by the next great idea, kept me from ever actually finishing this game.  It worked as far as it went, though, and I like to think it was fun to play.  In 2010 I started to convert it to REALbasic, so as to finally finish it, but again failed to follow through.  Now and then I think about trying again -- and it's pretty much the _only_ project so old that tempts me so.  Maybe someday!
