# JoesCodeMemoir

## What's all this, then?

This repository contains ancient software artifacts created by Joe Strout, going all the way back to my childhood days in the 1980s, along with some notes and reminiscing triggered by them.

It's really nothing that's likely to be of much interest to anyone else, though maybe someday there will be code archaeologists who will find it interesting.

By adding this stuff here, it should make its way up to the [Software Heritage](http://softwareheritage.org) archive for safekeeping.
